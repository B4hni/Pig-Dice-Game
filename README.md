# Pig-Dice-Game
Welcome to the 'Pig' dice game! This is a simple command-line game where you play against the computer. Roll the die and accumulate points, but be carefulâ€”if you roll a 1, you lose all your points for that round. The first player to reach 30 points wins the game!

## How to Play
1. **Objective**: The first player to reach 30 points wins the game.
2. **Rolling the Die**: 
   - Each player (you and the computer) rolls a 6-sided die in each round.
   - If the die lands on a number other than 1, the value is added to your score.
   - If the die lands on 1, you lose all your points for that round.
3. **Winning the Game**: The game continues until either you or the computer reaches 30 points.
